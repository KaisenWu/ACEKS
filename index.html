  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>
    Hello <em>Ashish, Euchong, Rick and Sanmeet.</em><br><br>
    First of all. Very nice to be a member of our team.<br>
    I'm writing this letter since my English is sucks.<br>
    I'm worry about I can't express my opinion properly in our meeting, so I decide to give you<br />
    my opinion and suggestion in advance.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    I really wanna do everything by casual, but my 10-year design work expirience taught me that: <br />
    <em><b>If we want to complete one project, even it is not a complex one.<br>
        We still need to do things follow some principles.</b></em>
  </p>
  <p>So I write my suggestions below and expecting we can discuss on it.</p>
  <hr />
  <a href="Cooperation.html">Regarding to Our Cooperation</a><br />
  <a href="Implementation.html">Regarding to The Implementation of Our Project</a><br>
  <a href="Regulation.html">Regulation</a>
